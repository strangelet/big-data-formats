## pyarrow data api

> Arrow manages data in arrays `pyarrow.Array`, which can be grouped 
> in tables `pyarrow.Table` to represent columns of data in tabular data.

> Arrow also provides the `pyarrow.dataset` API to work with large data,
> which will handle for you partitioning of your data in smaller chunks
